# Nowhere Land - UI Mockups

This directory contains HTML mockups for the Nowhere Land personal blog platform, implementing the design specifications from `ui.md`.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The mockups follow a simple, clean design philosophy with:
- **Theme System**: Light/dark mode with smooth transitions
- **Responsive Grid**: 12-8-4 column system (lg/md/sm)
- **Consistent Styling**: Single border radius and color scheme
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML
- **Performance**: Minimal JavaScript, CSS-only animations

## 📱 Pages Implemented

### Core Pages ✅

1. **`base.html`** - Base template with theme system and common styles
2. **`home.html`** - Homepage with search, post list, and fixed tags sidebar
3. **`post-detail.html`** - Post view with TOC, content, comments, and related posts
4. **`post-write.html`** - Rich text editor with image upload and reference system
5. **`about-me.html`** - About page with contact sidebar and timeline
6. **`admin.html`** - Admin dashboard navigation
7. **`dashboard.html`** - Analytics dashboard with charts and metrics

### Additional Pages (Not Yet Implemented)

## 📊 Design Specifications Met

### Color Scheme
- **Light Mode**: Primary `#f1f0ed`, Secondary `#2D2926`, Accent `#D01C1F`
- **Dark Mode**: Primary `#2D2926`, Secondary `#f1f0ed`, Accent `#FF8200`
- **Neutral**: `#A7A8AA` for borders and backgrounds

### Typography
- System font stack for better performance
- Proper font sizing hierarchy
- Readable line heights
- Consistent spacing

### Grid System
- **Large screens (lg)**: 12 columns
- **Medium screens (md)**: 8 columns  
- **Small screens (sm)**: 4 columns
- Maximum width: 1280px (7xl)

### Components
- Rounded corners with consistent radius (`0.5rem`)
- Container and component box patterns
- Consistent button styles and states
- Form elements with proper focus states

## 🚀 Usage

### Viewing the Mockups
1. Open any HTML file in a web browser
2. Use browser dev tools to test responsive layouts
3. Toggle between light/dark themes using the theme button

### Customization
- Modify CSS custom properties to change colors
- Adjust grid breakpoints in media queries
- Update component spacing and sizing variables

### Integration Notes
- Styles are self-contained in each file for easy review
- JavaScript is minimal and focused on UI interactions
- Ready for conversion to component-based frameworks

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Border Radius Recommendation
Based on modern design trends and the project's simple aesthetic, I recommend using `0.5rem` (8px) as the standard border radius throughout the application.

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Small (sm)**: 0-767px (mobile)
- **Medium (md)**: 768-1023px (tablet)
- **Large (lg)**: 1024px+ (desktop)

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal JavaScript for core functionality
- CSS-only animations where possible
- Efficient grid layouts for mobile devices
- Optimized image sizing strategy

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Component Library**: Convert mockups to reusable components
2. **API Integration**: Connect to backend services
3. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
4. **Performance**: Optimize for Core Web Vitals
5. **Accessibility**: Full WCAG compliance audit
